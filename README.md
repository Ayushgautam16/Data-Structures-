# 🧠 Daily DSA – A2Z Sheet Progress Tracker 📈

Welcome to my **Daily DSA (DDSA)** journey! 🚀  
This repository documents my daily progress while following the **A2Z DSA Sheet** curated by [Striver (takeUforward)](https://takeuforward.org/).  
It covers **every essential topic** in **Data Structures and Algorithms**, from beginner to advanced, with a well-organized sequence and company-relevant problems.

## 🗂️ About the A2Z DSA Sheet

The A2Z DSA Sheet is a comprehensive DSA roadmap designed to take you from zero to hero in coding interviews. It consists of **450+ problems**, categorized and sequenced logically to ensure maximum understanding and retention.

Each section builds on the previous one, covering topics like:

- ✔️ Basics, Arrays & Strings
- ✔️ Searching & Sorting
- ✔️ Hashing & Prefix Sums
- ✔️ Recursion & Backtracking
- ✔️ Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- ✔️ Trees, BSTs & Binary Search
- ✔️ Heaps, Graphs & Tries
- ✔️ Dynamic Programming
- ✔️ Greedy, Bit Manipulation, and More!

## 📅 My DDSA Commitment

✅ **Daily Goal**: Solve at least 1–3 problems daily  
📌 **Tracking**: Each topic will have its own folder with problems, solutions, and notes  
💬 **Language Used**: Primarily Python / C++  
📘 **Approach**: Includes brute-force, optimized, and edge-case handling
